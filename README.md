# Exam-Timetable-Management-system
The Exam Hall Management System is a cutting-edge project created using the powerful C++ programming language. The system prioritizes security and starts by requiring login credentials for both COE instructors and students, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive exam-related information.

Upon successful login, the system provides a plethora of functionalities for managing exams. First, instructors can create courses, assign themselves to these courses, and register students for the exams. This feature is critical in keeping track of which courses are being offered, who is responsible for teaching them, and which students are taking the exams.

The Exam Timetable feature allows the creation of an exam schedule, indicating the date, time, and location of each exam. Instructors and students can also create new profiles and assign themselves to courses, with this information being stored in the database and easily retrievable and modifiable.

The system also provides a password change option, allowing both instructors and students to update their login credentials as needed. Students can view their registered exams, including the date, time, and location, and receive notifications from the instructor. The instructor can send messages to students, providing updates and critical exam-related information.

Lastly, the Exam Timetable feature allows easy modification of the exam schedule, ensuring flexibility and the ability to accommodate changes and updates. In summary, the Exam Hall Management System is a comprehensive and secure platform that makes exam management efficient, accessible, and up-to-date.
